# **Challenge 2: AI-Powered Governance for Decentralized Organizations**

## **Problem Statement:**

Create an AI-powered governance system that enhances decision-making within decentralized
organizations. Your solution should enable voting, proposal assessment, and community sentiment analysis to foster more inclusive and efficient governance.

## **Additional Guidelines:**

- Implement smart contracts to manage voting and proposal execution securely on the blockchain.
- Train AI models to analyze community feedback, sentiment, and voting patterns for better governance insights.
- Ensure transparency and security in the decision-making process, allowing stakeholders to
have a clear view of governance actions.
